					        	DBAA is excited to give a shout out to one of our members for a new publishing partnership with ScrewAttack Games for the release of <a href = "http://superradraygun.com">Super Rad Raygun</a>!
					        	<br><br>
					        	Chris Hernandez (Artist for Crystal Brawl) and Chris Bryant have worked together as TruFun Entertainment, and expect to launch the game this spring. Inspired by 4 color Gameboy aesthetics and classic 2d platforming mechanics, it will send players on a retro themed adventure through the 1980's, battling the Soviet Union and carrying out American foreign policy in a fun filled romp through the global conflict zones of the cold war! Fun!
					        	<br><br>
								Super Rad Raygun will launch on Steam this Spring for Mac and PC -
