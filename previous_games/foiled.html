					        	<p><a href = "http://http://www.foiledgame.com//" target="blank">Foiled</a> is local two player fighting game centered around soul-theft and a simple yet deceptively deep dueling system. Think Super Smash Bros meets Nidhogg.

Outwit, outwiggle, and outstab your off-color twin, then steal their soul. Demonstrate your outfakery, your outpokery, your well-timed mischievious swordplay, and generally juke your way to handing your friendly local opponent a completely humiliating takedown.

Controllers strongly recommended, but keyboards are supported. Some mind-games may apply.</p>
