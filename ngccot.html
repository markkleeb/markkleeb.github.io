		<p>Two people are trapped in a featureless room. After waiting in near-silence, a loaded gun drops from a hole in the ceiling, falling between them. What is this supposed to mean? What happens next? <br><br>
		This is a minimalist local multiplayer game based around the struggle for control of a deadly weapon.</p>
